    Infosys Foundation USA, Amazon, Facebook, Micros a doula and birth educator, I have spent the past few months listening to my clients’ voices crack in distress about what the coronavirus means for their upcoming births. Over text and video calls, they worry about the ever-changing hospital policies. I miss hugging these expectant mothers and being with them in person. But the coronavirus pandemic has only amplified what I always knew to be true: This country is failing when it comes to supporting birthing people, especially black women. <a href= "https://www.google.com/maps"> Google Maps</a>

    It’s no coincidence that the virus affects black people at a disproportionate rate. Systemic inequities like poor access to adequate health care and insurance, medical racism, food deserts, and the lack of generational economic mobility have set us up to be devastated by the pandemic. So does the fact that black Americans are statistically more likely to suffer from comorbidities like asthma, diabetes, and hypertension, which exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19. Black Americans also make up a large part of the unprotected essential workforce who may be exposed to the virus at higher rates.soft, Ali and Hadi Partovi, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, Ballmer Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Vista Equity Partners, Omidyar Network, Quadrivium Foundation, Verizon, Blizzard, Charlie Lee, Reid Hoffman, Linda and Glenn Greenberg, Jeff Bezos, AT&T, John and Ann Doerr, Pluralsight One, Atlassian, BlackRock, Salesforce, Sean Parker, Diane Tang and Ben Smith, Jeff Wilke, The Marie-Josée and Henry R.

                <p>Google Maps is a web mapping service developed by Google. It offers satellite imagery, aerial photography,<em>Google Maps' satellite view is a "top-down" or bird's-eye view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800 to 1,500 feet (240 to 460 m), while most other imagery is from satellites</em> street maps, 360° interactive panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle and air (in beta), or public transportation. In 2020, Google Maps was used by over 1 billion people every month.[1]

                     In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, <strong>Google Maps began as a C++ desktop program at Where 2 Technologies.</strong>which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005.[2] The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites,[3] and offers a locator for businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps were not discontinued as the company announced those features would be transferred to the Google Local Guides program</p>
