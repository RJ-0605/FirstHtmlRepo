             <p1> Liposuction is a cosmetic procedure that removes fat that you can’t seem to get rid of through diet and exercise.

                A plastic or dermatologic surgeon usually does the procedure on your hips, belly, thighs, buttocks, back, arms, or face to improve their shape. But liposuction can also be done with other plastic surgeries, including facelifts, breast reductions, and tummy tucks.
                
                Am I a Good Candidate?
                You’ll want to have realistic expectations. Liposuction won’t get rid of cellulite, so if you hoped you’d come out of surgery without any, you’re out of luck.
                
                Liposuction is a surgical procedure, and with it comes risks. So you need to be in good health before you get it. That means you must at least:
                
                Be within 30% of your ideal weight
                Have firm, elastic skin
                Not smoke
                Doctors don’t recommend the procedure if you have health problems with blood flow or have heart disease, diabetes, or a weak immune system.
